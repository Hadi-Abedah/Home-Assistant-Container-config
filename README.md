<h2> This repository provides configuration files to control my SONOFF smart switches. It assumes that a homeassistant core container is up and running using the formal Docker command provided by homeassistant documentation.</h2> 
<h4>Files should be placed in /config directory inside the container</h4>
<h4>The main idea is to control the refrigerator power sources according to solar power/AC grid availability.</h4>
<h4></h4>Inverter provided power is dynamic according to cloud cover and total sun hours.</h4>
<h4>Total AC grid power availability is logged to a csv file</h4>
